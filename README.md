### Where do I host it?
I use Netlify! They provide great CI/CD, and come heavily recommended

### Notes
- There are two branches - **Master** is what I use for my actual site, so you can see a working example. **Boilerplate** is much simpler, and is a good starting point. 
- There are a few references for a 'testimonials' section which I commented out; but you can use it as you see fit! Easiest way would be to search for those references and uncomment the sections (And you'll need to add it as a component in ```src/App.js```)
- You can change the progress bars in ```public/css/layout.css``` - you will see a section named "Skill Bars."
