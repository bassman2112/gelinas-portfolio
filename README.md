A simple SPA Portfolio template for developer/designers built with React.


## How to use
1. Clone/Download the repo.
2. Run  ``` npm install ```.
3. Run ```npm start``` to spin the up the local dev server port 3000.(http://localhost:3000).
4. Make whatever changes you need in ```src/resumeData.js``` .

## Notes
- There are a few references for a 'testimonials' section which I commented out; but you can use it as you see fit! Easiest way would be to search for those references and uncomment the sections (And you'll need to add it as a component in ```src/App.js```)
- You can change the bars in ```public/css/layout.css``` - you will see a section named "Skill Bars." 
- If you want a more boilerplate/fill in the blanks version of this, switch to branch "boilerplate"
